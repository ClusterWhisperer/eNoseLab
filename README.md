### eNoseLab Project 

Motivated by the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305385157_Online_decorrelation_of_humidity_and_temperature_in_chemical_sensors_for_continuous_monitoring) presented by 
Ramon Huerta, Thiago Mosqueiro, Jordi Fonollosa, Nikolai Rulkov, Irene Rodriguez-Lujan. Online Decorrelation of Humidity and Temperature in Chemical Sensors for Continuous Monitoring. Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems 2016.

This project aims to build a streaming infrastructure to process the IoT data in real time, during this process we wanted to 
explore different technologies (ex: Spark Streaming, Kafka Streaming, Apache flink etc) that a better fit for this usecase. 

@todo ... add more details.
